## Overview
Ogre is a CLI and Daemon which delivers out of the box container monitoring by
means of health checks and other telemetry. Ogre can be installed as a binary
on the host, or deployed using Docker on an image of your choice or by using
our public ogre Docker image.

Ogre helps developers of modern distributed applications gather valuable
telemetry quickly and easily. There are no doubt more robust systems for any
single aspect ogre provides, however, ogre's goal is not to provide any single
functionality with depth. Rather, ogre seeks to provide basic telemetry for a
modern day distributed micro service deployed using Docker, which is often a
critical blocker for early adoption of a service.
